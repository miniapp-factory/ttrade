#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create this file to describe the logo you want to generate.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a simple, modern house silhouette with a stylized sofa and a table inside. The house outline is a clean gray shape, the sofa is a bright blue rectangle with a small cushion, and the table is a light brown rectangle with a single round leg. The background is a soft pastel green gradient from top-left to bottom-right, giving a fresh, eco-friendly feel. The overall composition is centered and balanced, with the house slightly tilted to the right to suggest movement and exchange. The logo should be clear and recognizable at small sizes, using bold lines and minimal detail.
